#Gwen Weston - Implementing Compassion
TED talk :)

#Francisco Díaz - Move fast and keep your code quality
talk about quality
franciscodiaz.cl
proud not about of number of lines but quality of code
less quality->more bugs->less productivity
quality:
0 good definition of requirements
1 less bugs
2 speed addinng new features

flat hierarchy is a lie (informal leadership)
manager facilitates but not make decisions by his own, team makes decisions
rely on async tools (slack)
work in the office like you're working remotely
teams are not important than projects -> form projects around teams
good team:
1 small
2 share knowledge (and cross teams). study groups
3 pull request and code review (swift lint, automate style)
4 xcode templates in repo

SAY NO! -> be professional

increase productivity means increase quality

#Martijn Walraven - Strong typing from the server to the UI with GraphQL
GraphQL
share code between server and client (mobile app)
REST is good, but it costs (time) - example with github API
"why would we let server decide what data to return?" > solution GraphQL
one endpoint, request by sending query
you get the data you only need
SCHEMA strongly typed self-documented contract between server and client. provided by the server (data models)

tool: GraphiQL https://github.com/graphql/graphiql
www.graphql.org
it's opensourced
you can reuse queries (`fragment`)
schema changes must be backward compatible!!!
no need to different API versions
every field in schema is a function() on the server

##client side
swift library, strong typed
https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios
Query models instead of business object models

caching:
normalized caching, keeping query results consistent

one-way data flow:
mutations
optimistic updates
real-time updates
